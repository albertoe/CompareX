# CompareX 

A console app that allows you to create a snapshot of the files within a directory by storing their corresponding MD5 hash into a database and allow you to compare it in the future.

## Scenarios
You want to know what files are changed or deleted after installing a new version of the program.

So prior to installing the program you can create a snapshot of the directory where the app is installed and after updating it you can ask CompareX to tell you what are the files that changed.
